# 🏡 Housing Prices Analysis

## ✨ Overview
In this project, I explored a housing dataset to understand how different factors like location, area, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms affect the price of houses. The goal was to identify what influences housing prices the most and uncover interesting patterns from the data.

## 📊 What I Did
- Loaded and cleaned the dataset using **Pandas**
- Used **Matplotlib** to visualize relationships between features
- Found out how things like square footage, number of rooms, and locality impact the house price
- Spotted outliers and checked how they affect the data
- Created heatmaps and scatter plots to highlight key trends

## 🔧 Tools Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** for visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebook** for writing and running the code

## 📁 Files Included
- `housing_prices_analysis.ipynb`: The main notebook with all code, charts, and insights
- `README.md`: You're reading it right now!

## 💡 Key Insights
- There is a strong correlation between house price and the size of the house
- Certain locations consistently have higher prices
- More bedrooms or bathrooms don’t always mean a higher price – it depends on the area too

## 🤔 What I Learned
This project helped me improve my EDA skills and gave me a clearer understanding of how real estate data behaves. I learned how to dig into raw data, clean it, visualize it, and draw meaningful conclusions.
